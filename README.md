This is a social bookmarking web app, in the vein of [Delicious](http://del.icio.us).

This repo is meant to illustrate Test-Driven Development (TDD) of a React app. Any resemblance to a useful web app, living or dead, is merely coincidental.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the [guide for create-react-app here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
